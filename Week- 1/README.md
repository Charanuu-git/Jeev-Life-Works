Java Input & Output Practice – Week 1 Task
This is a simple Java console program designed to help beginners practice using the Scanner class for input and reinforce fundamental concepts such as data types, arithmetic operations, and control flow.

📋 Program Description
The program performs the following steps:

Prompts the user to:

Enter two integer numbers.
Enter a floating-point number.
Enter a single character.
Enter a boolean value (true or false).
Enter their name.
Processes the input and displays:

The sum, difference, and product of the two integers.
The result of multiplying the floating-point number by 2.
The next character in the ASCII sequence after the entered character.
The logical opposite of the boolean value.
A personalized greeting message using the entered name.
🧪 Sample Output
Enter the first integer: 10
Enter the second integer: 20
Enter a floating-point number: 5.5
Enter a single character: A
Enter a boolean value (true/false): true
Enter your name: John

Sum of 10 and 20 is: 30
Difference between 10 and 20 is: -10
Product of 10 and 20 is: 200
5.5 multiplied by 2 is: 11.0
The next character after 'A' is: B
The opposite of true is: false
Hello, John!
